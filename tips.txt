A new way of writing useState hook is like this:
📍const arr = useState(list)
- In this case, list is an array. When we console arr, it returns a variable and a function. So, we can destructure that variable and function like this:
📍const resList = arr[0]
📍const setResList = arr[1]
And it will work exactly like this:
📍const [resList, setResList] = useState(list)
